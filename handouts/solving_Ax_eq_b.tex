\section{Solvability conditions on $b$}
The system of equations $Ax = b$ is solvable exactly when $b$ is in
the column space $\mathrm{C(A)}$.

\section{Complete solution to $Ax = b$}
To find complete solution to a solvable system of equation $Ax = b$

\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] Find $x_p$, a particular solution of $Ax = b$ by setting all
free variables to zero and solve for pivot variables.

\item[(ii)] Find $x_n$, general solution to the homogenous equation
$Ax = 0$.
\end{itemize}

The general solution to $Ax = b$ is given by $x = x_p + x_n$.
\section{Rank of a matrix}
The rank of a matrix is the number of pivots of that matrix. If $r$
is the \emph{rank} of an $m \times n$ matrix $A$. Then $r \leq m$ and
$r \leq n$.

\subsection{Full column rank}
If $r = n$, then \emph{nullspace} contains only the \emph{zero vector}.
If $Ax = b$ has a solution it is unique, so that there is either $0$ or
$1$ solution.

\subsection{Full row rank}
If $r = m$, the equation $Ax = b$ can be solved for any $b$. Since there
are $n - r = n - m$ free variables, the equation $Ax = 0$ has $n - m$
special solutions.

\subsection{Full row and column rank}
If $r = m = n$, then $A$ is an \emph{invertible} square matrix. The
\emph{nullspace} has dimension $0$, $Ax = b$ has a unique solution for
every $b$ in $\mathbb{R}^m$.
